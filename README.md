# BlueTrigger (Android Bluetooth Automation)

BlueTrigger is an Android app that reacts instantly when a Bluetooth device connects or disconnects.  
You can assign custom actions like Lock Phone, Toggle Flashlight, Launch Camera, or Open an App.

It runs reliably in the background using a Foreground Service and BroadcastReceivers, even on modern Android versions (12 to 15).
